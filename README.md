## 🏡 House Price Prediction (End-to-End ML Project)


# 📌 Project Overview

This project is an End-to-End Machine Learning application that predicts house prices based on features like size (m²) and number of bedrooms.

# It covers the full ML lifecycle:

- Data preprocessing

- Model training using Multiple Linear Regression

- Model persistence with Pickle

- Interactive Streamlit frontend for user input and predictions

# 🚀 Features

- 📊 Predict house price in ₹ (thousands) based on input features

- ⚡ Real-time prediction through a Streamlit web app

- 🛠️ Scaled features using StandardScaler for consistent results

- 🔍 Model evaluation with R² score and error metrics

- 🖥️ Clean, user-friendly UI

# 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python 🐍

- Scikit-learn (ML model)

- Streamlit (Frontend)

- NumPy / Pandas (Data processing)

- Matplotlib (Visualization)
